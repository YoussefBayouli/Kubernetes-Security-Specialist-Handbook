## The 4C's:

### Cloud:
### Definition: 
Encompasses the secure utilization of cloud infrastructure and services.
Security Focus: Ensuring secure access, data integrity, encryption, and proper configuration of cloud resources.

# Clusters:
## Definition: 
Involves the secure orchestration and management of containerized applications using platforms like Kubernetes.
Security Focus: Securing cluster infrastructure, controlling resource access, and ensuring workload integrity and isolation.
## Authentication: 
#### 1. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
Use RBAC to manage access: Ensure you leverage Kubernetes RBAC to control access to resources based on user roles. Grant the least privilege necessary for users and services to operate.
Limit cluster-admin access: Avoid granting the cluster-admin role unless absolutely necessary. Regular users should have minimal permissions.
Regularly review and audit RBAC roles: Ensure roles and role bindings are regularly audited to detect over-provisioning of access.
#### 2. API Authentication
Use strong authentication methods: Enable secure methods like OpenID Connect (OIDC) for API server authentication, integrating with external identity providers.
Use service accounts for applications: Ensure that every application has its own service account, rather than using the default account, to ensure proper isolation and traceability.
Disable anonymous access: Disable anonymous API access to prevent unauthorized requests to the Kubernetes API.
#### 3. Network Policies
Implement Network Policies: Ensure that network traffic is controlled between namespaces and pods. Define which services can communicate, limiting lateral movement within the cluster in case of compromise.
Default deny policy: Start with a "deny-all" network policy and then whitelist allowed traffic.
#### 4. Secret Management
Use Kubernetes Secrets securely: Store sensitive data like passwords and tokens in Kubernetes Secrets, and mount them as environment variables or files, rather than hardcoding them in images or configurations.
Encrypt secrets at rest: Enable encryption of Secrets at rest using Kubernetes EncryptionConfig to protect stored Secrets from unauthorized access.
Rotate secrets regularly: Implement policies to rotate Secrets frequently to minimize exposure in case of a compromise.
#### 5. Authentication Integration
Use external identity providers: Configure Kubernetes to use an external authentication system like LDAP, OAuth, or SAML to authenticate users through established identity systems, reducing the risk of managing credentials directly in the cluster.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA): Integrate MFA for added security when accessing the Kubernetes API, especially for sensitive roles and administrative accounts.
#### 6. Certificate Management
Use client certificates: For service-to-service authentication and communication, ensure you use mutual TLS (mTLS) with client certificates.
Automate certificate management: Use tools like Cert-Manager to automatically issue and renew TLS certificates, reducing the risk of expired certificates causing outages.
#### 7. Pod Security
Use Pod Security Standards: Adopt Kubernetes Pod Security Standards (Baseline, Restricted) to ensure your pods are following best security practices, particularly in terms of user permissions and the use of non-root containers.
#### 8. Audit Logging
Enable API audit logs: Ensure that API server audit logs are enabled to track authentication and authorization events. This can help detect suspicious activities or policy violations.
Log and monitor access attempts: Implement systems to log and monitor user access attempts and regularly review these logs for potential threats.

## Authorization: 
#### 1. Use RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Effectively
Principle of Least Privilege: Always grant the minimum set of permissions required for users and services. For example, avoid giving cluster-admin privileges to regular users.
Role and RoleBinding: Use Role and RoleBinding for namespace-specific access control. For example, bind users or services to specific roles within a namespace rather than cluster-wide roles when they don’t need full access.
ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding: Use ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding sparingly for permissions that need to apply across the entire cluster. Ensure only admins or critical system components use them.
#### 2. Restrict Access to Kubernetes API
Disable Unauthorized API Access: Use RBAC to restrict access to the Kubernetes API. Disable anonymous access, and ensure only authenticated and authorized users can perform actions.
Control Sensitive Operations: Limit access to sensitive Kubernetes API operations such as creating or deleting pods, modifying secrets, or changing cluster configurations. Only trusted roles should be allowed to perform these actions.
Use Admission Controllers: Implement and configure Admission Controllers like PodSecurityPolicy, NodeRestriction, and others to enforce security policies and control what users or pods can do at runtime.
#### 3. Impose Resource Quotas and Limits
Enforce Resource Quotas: Use ResourceQuota objects to enforce limits on resource consumption within namespaces. This prevents over-allocation of resources and ensures users or teams cannot exhaust cluster resources.
Limit Ranges: Use LimitRange objects to define limits on the amount of resources (CPU, memory) that containers can use within a namespace. This helps prevent any single application or user from monopolizing resources.
#### 4. Network Policy for Service Authorization
Network Policies for Access Control: Use NetworkPolicy objects to restrict traffic between pods and services. Define which services are allowed to communicate with each other at the pod level, based on namespaces, labels, and ports.
Isolate Sensitive Workloads: Isolate critical or sensitive workloads from less trusted components using strict network policies, ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed.
#### 5. Pod Security Policies (PSP) / Pod Security Admission
Pod Security Admission: Apply Pod Security Standards (Baseline, Restricted) to ensure that pods adhere to security best practices like running as non-root, dropping unnecessary capabilities, and limiting privileged operations.
Pod-level Access Control: Use security contexts to define what a pod or container can do, restricting access to the node’s resources. For example, disallowing host network access, setting readOnlyRootFilesystem, and not allowing privileged containers.
#### 6. Service Account Authorization
Use Separate Service Accounts: Each workload (pod or application) should have its own dedicated service account with only the permissions it needs to operate. This avoids using the default service account, which may have more privileges than necessary.
Service Account RoleBindings: Create custom RoleBindings for each service account to enforce strict authorization boundaries for individual services.
Service Account Tokens: Use short-lived service account tokens to limit the risk of token abuse if compromised.
#### 7. Limit Access to Sensitive Resources
Restrict Access to Secrets: Use RBAC to strictly control who or what can access Kubernetes Secrets. Only authorized users, processes, or service accounts should have access to these sensitive resources.
Separate Sensitive Data: Isolate sensitive data like credentials, keys, or other security-critical information into dedicated namespaces and limit access using roles.
#### 8. Audit and Review Authorization Policies
Regular Policy Audits: Continuously audit RBAC policies, network policies, and access control configurations to ensure they remain effective and up to date. Use Kubernetes audit logs to track changes to RBAC configurations.
Monitor Role Usage: Regularly monitor and analyze the usage of roles to ensure they are not over-privileged or being misused. Consider tools that can help with this analysis by showing unused or redundant roles.
#### 9. Webhook Authorization
Use Webhook Authorization for External Controls: If you have external authorization systems, integrate them using the Webhook authorization mechanism. This allows you to centralize authorization decisions outside Kubernetes and apply external security policies.
External Authorization Checks: Use the Webhook API to extend Kubernetes authorization with external checks based on company policy or compliance requirements.
#### 10. Limit Self-Access Modifications
Prevent Privilege Escalation: Ensure that users and service accounts cannot escalate their privileges (e.g., avoid granting access to RBAC resources that could allow a user to give themselves more permissions). Configure Admission Controllers to enforce policies that prevent this.
Use Impersonation Safeguards: If using impersonation, ensure that only trusted users or services can impersonate others, to prevent unauthorized access.
#### 11. Avoid Wildcard Permissions
Avoid using * in RBAC rules: Avoid granting broad permissions using wildcards like *, as this can unintentionally grant more access than intended. Instead, explicitly define what resources and verbs are allowed.
#### 12. Enforce Namespace Boundaries Namespace Segregation: 
Separate different workloads or teams into different namespaces and enforce RBAC policies at the namespace level. This ensures that users or services cannot access resources in other namespaces unless explicitly authorized.
#### 13. Use SelfSubjectAccessReview for Authorization Debugging
Check Access with SelfSubjectAccessReview: Use Kubernetes’ SelfSubjectAccessReview API to verify what actions a user or service account is allowed to perform. This is useful for debugging and testing authorization policies.

# Admission Control: 
#### 1. Enable Necessary Admission Controllers
Use recommended admission controllers: Kubernetes has a variety of built-in admission controllers, and some should always be enabled for security purposes. Common security-related admission controllers include:
PodSecurity (formerly PodSecurityPolicy): Enforces pod security standards based on predefined profiles (privileged, baseline, restricted).
NamespaceLifecycle: Prevents modifications to system-critical namespaces (like kube-system) and allows control over the lifecycle of other namespaces.
NodeRestriction: Ensures that kubelets can only modify the resources of pods scheduled on their nodes.
LimitRanger: Ensures that resource constraints (CPU, memory) are applied to pods and containers within a namespace.
ResourceQuota: Enforces limits on the total resources a namespace can consume.
DenyEscalatingExec: Blocks exec, attach, and portforward commands in privileged pods to prevent privilege escalation.
AlwaysPullImages: Forces containers to pull images every time they start, ensuring the latest version is used and that image tampering is prevented.
2. Use Pod Security Admission (PSA) or Pod Security Policies (PSP)
Pod Security Admission: With Kubernetes’ deprecation of PodSecurityPolicies (PSP), Pod Security Admission (PSA) is now the preferred way to enforce security standards for pods. PSA validates pods against privileged, baseline, and restricted policies.
Adopt PodSecurity standards:
Restricted: Enforces the highest level of security by disallowing privileged containers, limiting access to host namespaces, and enforcing non-root users.
Baseline: Ensures that basic best practices like dropping unnecessary capabilities and using non-root containers are followed.
Privileged: Provides minimal security restrictions (only for trusted workloads).
Migration from PSP: If you’re still using PSP, migrate to PodSecurity Admission before PSP is fully deprecated.
3. Use Validating Admission Webhooks
Validate incoming resources: Configure validating admission webhooks to enforce custom policies and rules. This allows for dynamic, custom validation of API requests before they are persisted.
External policy checks: Use admission webhooks to connect to external systems for validating requests based on company policies, compliance, or business logic. For example, you can prevent pods from being deployed without specific labels or security settings.
4. Use Mutating Admission Webhooks
Automate resource modifications: Mutating admission webhooks allow you to automatically modify incoming requests. For instance, they can inject default configurations, set security context parameters, or apply environment-specific settings.
Common use cases:
Injecting sidecar containers (e.g., logging or security agents).
Ensuring certain annotations or labels are added.
Automatically setting pod security context (e.g., enabling non-root users).
Applying resource limits to pods if they are missing.
5. Use Admission Controllers for Compliance
Compliance and security enforcement: Use admission controllers to enforce organizational compliance and security policies by rejecting or mutating resources that don't meet requirements.
Enforce image security policies: For example, reject requests to deploy containers from untrusted registries or that use unscanned images.
Force image pull policies: Use the AlwaysPullImages admission controller to ensure that Kubernetes always pulls the latest image from a trusted source, preventing the use of outdated or insecure images.
6. Restrict Use of Privileged Containers
Block privileged pods: Use validating admission controllers or PSA to block pods that request elevated privileges such as using the hostPID, hostNetwork, or running as root.
Enforce non-root containers: Ensure that workloads run as non-root users by default using Pod Security Admission or custom admission webhooks.
7. Enforce Resource Quotas and Limits
Use ResourceQuota admission controller: Set resource quotas at the namespace level to enforce limits on CPU, memory, and storage. This prevents resource exhaustion and helps in capacity planning.
Use LimitRange admission controller: Enforce minimum and maximum values for container resources (CPU, memory) within a namespace, ensuring fair resource allocation and preventing overconsumption.
8. Namespace and Lifecycle Management
NamespaceLifecycle Admission Controller: Use this controller to control what operations are allowed within specific namespaces. For example, you can prevent the deletion of critical system namespaces (kube-system, kube-public) and enforce policies for namespace creation and deletion.
Namespace-level policy enforcement: Use Admission Controllers to ensure that resources in a namespace conform to predefined policies (e.g., quota enforcement, no access to certain system namespaces).
9. Enforce Image Security
ImageSignature Admission Controller: Use this to enforce the use of signed and verified container images. Ensure that only trusted images from verified sources are allowed to run in your cluster.
AlwaysPullImages Admission Controller: Enforce the policy that Kubernetes always pulls the latest image from the registry, ensuring no outdated or tampered images are used.
10. Audit and Test Admission Controllers
Test admission webhooks and policies: Before rolling out in production, ensure you thoroughly test all admission controllers and webhooks in a staging environment. This helps avoid issues caused by rejected or mutated requests.
Audit webhook logs: Regularly audit the logs from admission controllers to track what requests are being mutated or rejected. This helps identify potential misconfigurations or policy violations.
11. Implement Dynamic Admission Control with OPA/Gatekeeper
Policy-as-code with OPA/Gatekeeper: Use Open Policy Agent (OPA) with Gatekeeper to implement dynamic, fine-grained admission policies that ensure Kubernetes resources meet security, compliance, and operational standards. OPA allows for more complex and flexible policy definitions compared to built-in admission controllers.
Enforce policies for resources: OPA can be used to validate various aspects of Kubernetes resources, such as ensuring that all pods have specific security settings, enforcing naming conventions, or requiring specific labels or annotations.
12. Monitoring and Auditing Admission Control
Enable Admission Control audit logs: Ensure admission control activity is logged and audited. Admission webhooks and other controllers should log all rejected or modified requests for security and compliance tracking.
Continuous monitoring of admission policies: Use monitoring tools to continuously assess and review the effectiveness of the admission controllers. Ensure that policy violations or rejected requests are flagged and investigated.
