# Kubernetes-Security-Specialist-Handbook
## Cloud Native Security - 4C's Framework
### Overview:
This repository introduces the 4C's framework, a foundational approach to ensuring robust security in cloud-native environments. The 4C's represent key pillars that collectively contribute to a comprehensive security strategy.

## The 4C's:

### Cloud:
### Definition: 
Encompasses the secure utilization of cloud infrastructure and services.
Security Focus: Ensuring secure access, data integrity, encryption, and proper configuration of cloud resources.

### Clusters:
### Definition: 
Involves the secure orchestration and management of containerized applications using platforms like Kubernetes.
Security Focus: Securing cluster infrastructure, controlling resource access, and ensuring workload integrity and isolation.

### Containers:
### Definition: 
Focuses on the secure deployment and runtime environment for containerized applications.
Security Focus: Secure container image practices, runtime monitoring, and vulnerability management.

### Code:
### Definition: 
Pertains to the security of application code and associated scripts in cloud-native environments.
Security Focus: Emphasizes secure coding practices, continuous security testing, and integration into the DevOps pipeline.
Purpose:
This framework follows the best practice of defense in depth, promoting a layered security approach to address evolving cybersecurity threats in cloud-native landscapes.

### Usage:
Explore the documentation and resources in each directory for detailed insights into securing cloud-native applications at each level of the 4C's framework.

Note: Adapt and integrate these security practices into your development lifecycle to establish a resilient and secure cloud-native foundation.
